üöÄ **Let's shake things up in KVM technology together!**

We're hard at work developing [the host applications](https://openterface.com/quick-start/#install-host-application) for this handy gadget. Our team is coding away and tweaking these tools to boost their performance and functionality. We‚Äôre all about open hardware and open-source software, and we'll keep sharing updates throughout our campaign.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Ready for Release

We're sprucing up our code and getting our repos in shape for everyone to use. We want to make sure everything is neat and user-friendly for you. Plus, we'll open up all repos before the end of our crowdfunding campaign! Just bear with us a little longer!
